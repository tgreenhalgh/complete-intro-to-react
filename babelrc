command line: (better to make a config file)
webpack --module-bind='js=babel' js/ClientApp.js public/bundle.js

module-bind says whenever find a js file, run it through babel


// babel has two concepts: plugin & preset
// a preset is a group of plugins
{
  "presets": [
  "react", // all the JSX transformations (from JSX to ES5)
  // es2015 has ALL the plugins to get from ES6 to ES5
  // don't do for production, just include the plugins needed
  [ "es2015", { "modules": false } // modules: false means
                      // don't transform the ES6 module imports
                      // because we want WebPack to take care of it
                      // because can do "tree shaking" only include
                      // code  that's actually run (Uglify takes out
                      // the code that can't be run)
                      // synonymous to "live code inclusion"
                      // which is different from "dead code exclusion"
                      // uglify does live code inclusion (tree shaking)
                      // uglify is included in WebPack

                      , "loose": true // loose excludes the edge cases
                      ]
  ]

  "plugins": [
    include only what's needed here
  ]
}

// note: 'react' preset is fine for production

Babel transforms code from ES6 to ES5
WebPack bundles all the code
Uglify gets rid of all the code that's not used
